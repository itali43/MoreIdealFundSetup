# More Ideal Fund Structure [🚧 In-Progress 👷🏻‍♂️]
### 💸📈 My proposals for a properly incentive-aligned fund structure 📈💸

## Setup
To my mind, just about every Hedge Fund (that I am aware of, and that isn't all of them) has their incentive structure set up in a misaligned way.  Here’s (in my opinion) a modestly better model.  I think it can be applied fairly modularly.

### **Initiation Fee:** 
_(Optional)_ - Upfront charge, between 1-2% of wealth in.  Potentially more desirable alternative would be a static fee that’s 1-2% of what you want investors to invest.  
*   Non-repeating
*   Used for operations in place of the 2% yearly that is normally charged
*   Shows that an investor is willing to pay for what they get, partner not customer.

### **Yearly Management Fees:** 
#### _None._  
If you can’t eat off of your profits you either gave too large of bonuses last year, you spent your Initiation fee on Lambos instead of investing with your LPs in your promised first year profits, or you didn’t raise enough money.

### **Profit Take:**  
Higher but reasonable.  I've read of funds getting only a percentage of profit after they outperform the market (S&P500) that year.  While I think this is better than not for the current commonly used model, I actually think (especially with this new model) it encourages poor risk taking and forgets that it's not the years you do a little worse than the market but positive that kill you it's the years you do double digit negative returns.  Risk matters as much as profit for long term wealth accumulation.

### **Time Lockup:**  
Only work with people you trust.  Tell your investors this.  They will be demonstrating this by having the money lock up for an extended period of time.  PE-level of lockup.  

### **Mandate:**  
Contractually-- minimal to none.  Obviously this should be dependent on preference of LPs and managers.  The logic behind this is that if you give someone your money for 5 years, there shouldn’t be a lot of fences disallowing them from making you money.  

Those fences are for avoiding risk and loss you say?  Fair, and true.  I wouldn’t want to give my money to someone who doesn’t build their own fences, or at least would be trustworthy enough to talk with me about why the rules need to be amended, or even act on a very positive find in an out of scope area.  If you'd like a specific flavor of fund, one should consider an actively managed index fund (or a hedge fund ran like one)-- if you want someone to be most incentivized to make you money, I don't think you want them to need traffic cones to navigate effectively.


## 🔑 Philosophy of this Model: 🔑
(by the way, it’s just that—a model, not gospel)

### 🔑 - _Radical Trust._

### 🔑 - Complete Ownership.
By this design, the fund manager is basically investing as if it was their own money.  Most people are far more careful with their own money.  And the best way to really fail as a fund is to make tons of money until that one trade the sinks the whole company.

### 🔑 - Skin in the Game. 
Incentives are far more aligned for a good return AND proper risk aversion.  2 and 20 models can be excellent for returns but a misalignment with the risk the client takes and how well the hedge fund manager will do.
